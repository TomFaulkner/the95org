My hope is to make this site a useful resource for those wanting to learn more about Reformed theology, piety, and practice by providing solid, rich, and historical content spanning from the early Church through our modern times.

Submissions for author biographies are welcome and appreciated. Suggestions for articles to include are likewise appreciated. Please feel free to email me with all suggestions or inqueries, <cc@closetcalvinist.com>
