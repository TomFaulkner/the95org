I am a member of the historic Reformed Church, in particular the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. I [occasionally] blog, and tweet, under the psuedonym Closet Calvin.

##Why Closet Calvin?

When I learned of the doctrines of grace I was a member in good standing of the United Methodist Church. Unfortunately, circumstances in my congregation changed, and I began to blog about what I was seeing and learning. Due to my role in the congregation I thought it best not to do so under my own name, thus the psuedonym. I have [written more on that on my blog.](http://closetcalvinist.com/ "ClosetCalvinist.com")
